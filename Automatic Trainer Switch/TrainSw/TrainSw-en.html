  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The application is useful for users who take advantage of the Teacher/Student mode. It allows you to play an audio file to indicate the model control handover between the teacher and student. Switching controls to the teacher is done automatically as soon as he/she moves any transmitter gimbal. The teacher thus gains immediate control of the model.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
