  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p> The <b>Preflight Check</b> app can be used to remind you of the steps you need to take before the actual flight. When the transmitter starts up and the  model is loaded, a list of tasks will be displayed. Each of them must be manually confirmed after its fulfillment. You can add a custom task to the task list by editing the file "Apps/Preflight/data-&lt;lang&gt;.jsn" in the transmitter.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
